# AI167 - Ground your AI in business context: A hands-on with document grounding

## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2025 session called AI167 - Ground your AI in business context: A hands-on with document grounding.  

## Overview

In this hands-on session, we will explore how to make Large Language Models truly enterprise-ready by grounding them with your own business data using Grounding in SAP GenAI Hub.
Throughout this lab, you will learn how to:   

- Build and manage data repositories for grounding.  
- Create embeddings using the Vector API.  
- Process full documents using the Pipeline API.  
- Retrieve relevant context with the Retrieval API.  
- Apply grounding end-to-end using the Orchestration layer in SAP GenAI Hub.  

By the end of this session, you will have hands-on experience turning an LLM from a general-purpose assistant into a trusted, context-aware enterprise AI system that answers based on your data — not guesses.
So get ready — this is where ideas get real.
