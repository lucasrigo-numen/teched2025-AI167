# Exercise 3.2: Upload file to S3 Object Store

Before we can use the Pipeline API to create a data grounding pipeline we first need to ingest our document to da supported data source.
Overall the grounding module in GenAI Hun supports as of today the following data repositories:
* Microsoft Share Point 
* AWS S3
* SFTP 
* SAP Build Work Zone
* SAP Document Management Service.

For this Hands-on Session we will use the **AWS S3 object store** as data repository. 

For these step we are use again our API Client Bruno (Hope Kasimir is ok with that). 


## Configure connection to S3 Object Store 
➡️ Go Back to **Bruno** and expand ```AI167_S3ObjectStore``` (1).   
➡️ Click at top right corner on ```No Environments``` (2)      
➡️ Select ```Configure``` to start setting the environment variables.

The values for the respective key you get from the service key from your Object Store Instance on BTP Cockpit. 

➡️ Take values from TECHED2025-AI167/.objectStore-config.json and copy the respective value from the service key into Bruno.

➡️ After you added teh values, select **Save** and then **Activate**

To check whether everything was successfully uploaded you can run the ```GET List Objects ``` request. 

## From now, continue the exercise in Visual Studio Code
