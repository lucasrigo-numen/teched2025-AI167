# Setup Python Environment

For some of the exercises we will use **Visual Studio Code** to to run our python code. 

## 1.1 Open Visual Studio code and clone Git Repo

Open "Visual Studio Code" on your laptop. 
<p>

</p>

Once you opened your Visual Studio Code, you will see the **Welcome** tab. In this Welcome tab select under the **Start** section the option ```Clone Git Repository ``` to clone this Git repository with the exercises using the following URL  
```sh
https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2025-AI167.git 
```
Paste the URL into the command pallet at the top of the window and press enter.

</p>

Select and local directory on your laptop ( e.g. desktop) into which you want to clone the project then select ```Select as Repository Destination ```
<p>

</p>

When you receive the notification asking if you want to open the cloned repository, select ```Open```.
If everything was successful you should see the following folder structure in your Explorer:

## 1.2 Configure connection details for AI Core 
For this Hands-on Session we will use the grounding service on AI Core. 
To interact with AI Core, we need to get the service keys and add it to our python environment.
The service keys you will get in the BTP cockpit in the respective service instance, as described in the next steps. 


For the hands-on Session we provided separate [BTP Subaccounts](https://emea.cockpit.btp.cloud.sap/cockpit/?idp=tdct3ched1.accounts.ondemand.com#/globalaccount/4c772782-0751-42ee-93c3-897452fdcb63&//detail/862bffe2-c93b-4314-beef-18ccd09393b3/?layout=TwoColumnsMidExpanded-) for you. 
Please log in with your username and password provided in the workshop room and click on continue.

<p>

</p>

Once you successfully logged in, you will be redirected to the BTP Cockpit. To see the list of subaccount you need to click on **Account Explorer**.

➡️ Next click on the tile of your respective subaccount **AI167_XXX**.
<p>

</p>


➡️ Got to  **Instances and Subscription** and open the SAP AI Core Instance's **credentials**. 

<p>

</p>

➡️ Click **Copy Json**

➡️ Return to Visual Studio Code and create a new file ```.aicore-config.json```in the ```TECHED2025-AI167``` directory. 
<p>
<img src="images/new_file.png" width="900"/>
</p>

➡️ Paste in the service key into ```TECHED2025-AI167/.aicore-config.json```, which should look similar to the following.
<p>
<img src="images/config_file.png" width="900"/>
</p>

➡️  Save the file. 

## 1.2 Configure connection details Object Store 
Last but not least we have to do the same for the Object Store, that we are going to later in this hands-on session.
The service keys you will get in the BTP cockpit in the respective service instance, as described in the next steps. 


➡️ Navigate back again to  **Instances and Subscription** and open this time the  Object Store instance's service key.

<p>
<img src="images/s3_service_key.png" width="900"/>
</p>

➡️ Click **Copy Json**

➡️ Return to Visual Studio Code and create a new file ```.objectsStore-config.json```in the ```TECHED2025-AI167``` directory. 
<p>
<img src="images/new_file.png" width="900"/>
</p>

➡️ Paste in the object store service key into ```TECHED2025-AI167/.objectsStore-config.json```, which should look similar to the following.
<p>
<img src="images/object_store_config.png" width="900"/>
</p>

➡️  Save the file. 



## 1.3 Create a Python virtual environment and install the SAP Cloud SDK for AI
➡️ Start a new Terminal 
<p>
<img src="images/open_terminal.png" width="900"/>
</p>

➡️ Create a virtual environment using the following command:
```python
python3 -m venv ai167env --upgrade-deps
```
Activate the virtual environment ```ai167env``` like this and make sure it is activated.  
```python
source ai167env/bin/activate
```
<p>
<img src="images/env_active.png" width="900"/>
</p>
➡️ Install SAP Cloud SDK for AI (Python)

```python
pip install --require-virtualenv -U  "sap-ai-sdk-gen[all]" 
```
